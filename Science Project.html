and data transmission across the country,particularly in remote areas.</h3></p>
<p><h3>GSAT stands for 'Geosynchronous Satellite'.It is made by ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation).
</h3></p>
<p><h3>GSAT contributions are:-</h3></p>
<p><h3>1)<insert>Broadcasting services:-</insert>GSAT satellites are primarily used for television broadcasting, 
enabling wild reach for television signals across India.</h3></p>
<p><h3>2)<insert>Disaster management:-</insert>GSAT satellite system can be used for weather forecasting and 
disaster warning system,aiding in emergency response.</h3></p>
<p><h3>Satellites help with weather prediction, navigation and disaster management in many ways, including:-
<p><h3>1)<insert>Weather prediction:-</insert>Satellites provide real-time data on whether patterns.So, that 
we can tell people about wheather, temperature,etc.</h3></p>
<p><h3>2)<insert>Navigation:-</insert>Satellite provide navigation services.</h3></p>
<p><h3><insert>Disaster management:-</insert>Satellites help with disaster management by:-</h3></p>
<p><h3>1)Providing early warnings.</h3></p>
<p><h3>2)Mapping vulnerable areas.</h3></p>
<p><h3>3)Supporting post - disaster relief and recovery.</h3></p>
